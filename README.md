## GitHub Copilot Integration


-GitHub Copilot has been an incredible asset in developing our personal financial tracker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has significantly accelerated our coding process by providing intelligent code suggestions and snippets, enabling us to build the application more efficiently.</br>
-Copilot assisted in handling complex logic by suggesting code patterns or algorithms. It was useful in the instance of the removeTrans method, which entails validating the deletion and filtering the transactions array based on the ID. Copilot has offered suggestions on how to structure and implement this logic.</br>

## Additonal Comments
#### Copilot Improvement
-Its support for specialized functions was limited, necessitating additional effort and custom coding. Improvements focus on refining the model, enhancing contextual understanding, and promoting critical thinking capabilities.</br>

-Limited function support: Copilot primarily supports very commonly used inputs, it was a little hard to actually merge all the functions individually.</br>

#### Future Scope of MoneySensei
